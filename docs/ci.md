# CI and quality gates

## Job names

Branch protection keys on exact names. Renaming one silently disables the protection.

| Job                 | Runs                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `Format`            | `prettier --check .`                             |
| `Lint`              | `eslint .`                                       |
| `Typecheck`         | `tsc --noEmit` across every package              |
| `Policy gates`      | the six `check:*` scripts                        |
| `Test`              | `vitest` across every package, Node 22 and 24    |
| `Python test`       | `pytest` + `mypy` + `ruff`, Python 3.11 and 3.12 |
| `Build`             | turbo build + the Next.js production build       |
| `Doctor smoke test` | `tickrate-sim doctor` must exit 0                |
| `Secret scan`       | gitleaks over full history                       |
| `CodeQL`            | javascript-typescript and python, weekly         |

## The aggregate gate

`npm run check` is the exact command CI runs, in the same order. That is deliberate: local
and CI cannot drift, so a green local run means a green CI run.

Policy gates run **before** the expensive ones. A stray hex literal should fail in 200ms, not
after a three-minute build.

## The policy gates

| Gate                    | Fails when                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `check:skill-version`   | a `SKILL.md` body changed without a `metadata.version` bump      |
| `check:no-secrets`      | a credential is committed, or a `.env` has values                |
| `check:theme-tokens`    | a raw colour literal appears outside `styles/tokens.css`         |
| `check:boundaries`      | a package imports another package's undeclared deep path         |
| `check:public-hygiene`  | junk files, committed caches, oversized binaries, leftover TODOs |
| `check:readme-commands` | the README names a command that does not exist                   |

Each failure prints the file, the line, and the fix. A gate that only says "failed" wastes the
person running it.

## Supply chain

Every third-party action is pinned to a **commit SHA** with the version in a trailing comment.
A mutable tag means anyone who compromises the tag owns your CI.

## Adding a gate

1. Add `scripts/check-<name>.mjs`.
2. Wire it into `package.json` scripts.
3. Add it to `check` **before** the expensive steps.
4. Add a row to the table above.
5. Make sure it fails on a deliberately broken input — a gate that has never failed is not
   known to work.

## Local parity

```bash
npm run check     # identical to CI
```
